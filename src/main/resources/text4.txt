The Boeing F-15EX Eagle II is an American multirole all-weather strike fighter manufactured by Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Derived from the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and first conceived in 2018, the F-15EX is not expected to survive against modern air defenses by 2028, but has the capability to perform homeland and airbase defense, enforce no-fly zones against limited air defenses, and deploy standoff munitions. The aircraft made its maiden flight in February 2021, and as of 2023 has a total planned fleet size of up to 104. This F-15EX, from the United States Air Force's 40th Flight Test Squadron, was photographed flying over northern California during an aerial-refueling operation in May 2021.
